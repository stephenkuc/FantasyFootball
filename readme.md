This is the readme file for this Fantasy Football project.

Utilizing data from past years, I want to predict the next year's fantasy results. As an avid player, I'm always wondering and thinking of ways to possibly improve my teams and strategies for each year.

It is my goal to create notebooks to easily be able to predict results for an upcoming season, as long as data is available for the previous 2.

Using fields such as previous year's success, team success, and more, I want to predict results.
